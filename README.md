# ForgeCapabilities
Direct port of Forge's Capabilities system to Fabric to make my life easier.

Originally submitted as a PR for Porting Lib, however was rejected to favour the [Cardinal Components API](https://github.com/OnyxStudios/Cardinal-Components-API).

As I don't exactly want to have to port things to a completely separate system,
I've just thrown this into a separate library so it's quicker to reimplement things from it.
